How are events formatted in slack?
May need to learn SQL to export portions of .sqlite into JSON files
What is the diff between pass and continue in python, specifically with for loops involved
	continue goes onto the next loop interation, pass is a placeholder that does nothing

How is the timestamp formatted in Slack?
	It may be referenced in the other files, definitely check for what's been done already.
	It is referenced in archivebot.py which imports a module: datetime.

Currently have a model that turns the sqlite into JSON files in each dir
Now we need to change the header names of the sqlite dictionary to match Slack
but for lower coupling, we will make that change in the bridge app if possible
